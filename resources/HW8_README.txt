	I was able to implement all features from provided code (Add/Delete/Modify KeyFrame, Add/Delete Shape, Start, Pause, Resume, Restart) except one minor button functionality.
	Providers View interface had method setActionListeners(Controller controller) which would basically assign controller to catch action events from all buttons in the edit view. The problem I faced is that EditView was extending VisualView for my providers, and VisualView for some reason had "" button while editView had "Start/Resume" button.
	 So what happened is that when setActionListeners method is called in the editView it should have called super.setActionListeners to set action listener for that "Start" button sitting in the VisualView, but they didn't do so. I reached out with a "bug fix" request but got response. 
	As a result, "Start/Resume" does "Start" functionality and "Resume" as needed, but that "Start" button from VisualView has no actionListener being set, so it just does nothing. Other than that, everything functions properly
